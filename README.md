# COUNTING MEMBERS USING STATIC VARIABLE

# Overview

### This project demonstrates how a static variable can be used in Java to track the total number of objects (members) created in a class. Static variables are shared among all instances of a class, making them ideal for storing data that is common to all objects.

# Implications of Using a Static Variable


## 1. Shared Across All Instances

### The static variable exists independently of individual objects.
### Every time a new object is created, the variable can be updated to reflect the total count.

 ## 2. Automatic Counting

### Incrementing the static variable in the class constructor ensures the total number of objects is tracked automatically.

## 3. Class-Level Access

###  static variable can be accessed directly using the class name, without needing an object instance.

## 4. Memory Efficiency

### Only one copy of the variable exists in memory, regardless of how many objects are created.

## 5. Practical Use Cases

   ### Monitoring the number of active users or connections.

   ### Enforcing limits on object creation.

   ### Tracking instances in applications where the total count is required.

# Conclusion

### Using a static variable to count members provides a centralized, memory-efficient, and reliable way to monitor object creation in a class. It is a common technique in object-oriented programming for managing shared data among instances.
