1. ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To implement a simple Member Management System in Java using Object-Oriented Programming concepts, demonstrating static variables and object instantiation.

2. ðŸ§  Algorithm
- Start
- Define a Member class with a static variable totalMembers and instance variable name
- Create a constructor to initialize name and increment totalMembers
- Add methods to retrieve member name and total member count
- In the Main class, create three Member objects
- Print each member's name and the total number of members created
- End

3. ðŸ’» Java Code
class Member {
    private static int totalMembers = 0;
    private String name;

    public Member(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        totalMembers++; 
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public static int getTotalMembers() {
        return totalMembers;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Member m1 = new Member("Alice");
        Member m2 = new Member("Bob");
        Member m3 = new Member("Charlie");

        System.out.println(m1.getName());
        System.out.println(m2.getName());
        System.out.println(m3.getName());
        System.out.println("Total Members Created: " + Member.getTotalMembers());
    }
}

4. ðŸ“¤ Output
Alice  
Bob  
Charlie  
Total Members Created: 3
